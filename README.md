# School Search LLM App

This app is designed to assist parents in searching for private schools in their area. The app collects data on various schools and offers personalized recommendations based on preferences such as location, curriculum, tuition, and more. Built using **LangChain** for backend logic and **Chainlit** for the user interface, this app makes school searching efficient and interactive.
